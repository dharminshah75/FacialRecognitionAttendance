# FacialRecognitionAttendance
This is the simplest facial recognition based attendance system you will find on the internet without much coding

Prerequisites:
Download and install the face recognition library by the following command:
pip install face_recognition

Load the faces of the students into the known_faces directory
Load the image on which you want to run the Facial Recognition test and want to find out which students are present.

Open FaceRecognition.py file and change the img_test = #your test image

Finally, run FaceRecognition.py by :
python FaceRecognition.py

Simple, wasn't it? ;)
